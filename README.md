 XAI_LoanPrediction

 # My Machine Learning Project
 I wanted to build a machine learning model that could predict whether a loan would be approved based on various factors like credit history, loan 
 amount etc using Explainable Ai.

 # What I Learned
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: SHAP values help interpret the output of machine learning models. They attribute the change in output to each feature in the input data. This helped me understand why my model was making certain predictions.

First time I applied the concept of Hyperparameter tuning which optimizes the various parameters for better prediction making.
